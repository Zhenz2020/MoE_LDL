The code provides two methods for label enhancement.  `get_nearest_neighbor_parameters_simple` is based on ordinary distance weighting, and `get_nearest_neighbor_parameters_manifold_learning` is based on the linear representation of popular learning. These function return a dict, mean represents the mean of the mixed Gaussian, and weight represents the weight of the individual Gaussian. The code also provides two methods for variance. `var_settled` represents fixed variance, and `var_determined_by_weight` represents variance adjustment according to weight. The function `draw_mix_gaussion` also provides a way to plot the mixed Gaussian.
