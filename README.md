Execute the script `LDL_moE_with_experts.py` to initiate the testing process. There are two datasets available for evaluation: a simulation dataset and a supply chain dataset. You can toggle between these datasets by setting the `data_set` parameter. By default, `data_set` is assigned the value `MoE_true_y`, which utilizes the actual target variables for training rather than relying on the predictions made by experts.
